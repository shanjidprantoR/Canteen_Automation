  <h1 align="center">Canteen Automation</h1>
In today’s age of fast food and take-out, many canteen have chosen to focus on
quick preparation and speedy delivery of orders rather than offering a rich dining
experience. Until very recently, all of these delivery orders were placed to the waiters
or over the phone, but there are many disadvantages to this system, including the inconvenience
of the customer needing to have a physical copy of the menu, lack of a visual
confirmation that the order was placed correctly, and the necessity for the canteen
to have an employee answering the phone and taking orders. What,we propose is a Canteen
Automation System, which is a technique of ordering foods online applicable in any food
delivery industry. The main advantage of this system is that it greatly simplifies the
ordering process for both the customer and the canteen. When the customer visits the ordering
webpage, they are presented with an interactive and up-to-date menu,complete with all available options
and dynamically adjusting prices based on the selected options. After making a selection, the item is
then added to their order, which the customer canreview the details of at any time before checking out.
This provides instant visual confirmation of what was selected and ensures that items in the order are,
in fact, what was intended.<br>
This system also greatly lightens the load on the canteen’s end, as the entire process of taking orders
is automated. Once an order is placed on the webpage, it is entered into thedatabase and then retrieved,
in pretty much real-time, by a desktop application on the canteen’send. Within this application, all items
in the order are displayed, along with their correspondingoptions and delivery details, in a concise and
easy to read manner. This allows canteenemployees to quickly go through the orders as they are placed and
produce the necessary itemswith minimal delay and confusion</p>
